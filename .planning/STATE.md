# Project State

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

## Phase Status
planned

## Completed Phases
(none)

## Session Log
- 2026-02-28: Project initialized via /gsd:new-project
- 2026-02-28: Deep questioning completed — vision, constraints, preferences captured
- 2026-02-28: 4 parallel research agents completed (Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls)
- 2026-02-28: REQUIREMENTS.md created — 83 v1 requirements, 11 v2 deferred
- 2026-02-28: ROADMAP.md created — 7 phases, full requirement coverage

## Key Decisions
- Docker Compose Full: API + PostgreSQL + Redis all containerized
- Multi-currency from v1 (TRY + EUR + USD) — differs from original docs
- Admin portal first, tenant portal deferred to v2
- e-Fatura deferred — Stripe invoice = sole document for v1
- Single airport demo (ADB), multi-airport architecture-ready
- Amendment: next full period only (no mid-month proration)
- MAG: no carry-forward, monthly independent
- YOLO mode, parallel execution, research + plan-check + verifier enabled

## Blockers
(none)

## Session Log (continued)
- 2026-03-01: Phase 1 research completed (01-RESEARCH.md) — HIGH confidence
- 2026-03-01: Phase 1 planning completed — 4 plans in 3 waves
- 2026-03-01: Plan-checker found 4 blockers, 5 warnings — all fixed
- 2026-03-01: Plans revised: Task split, PostgreSQL 15 fix, auth paths per API docs, unit tests added, health prefix excluded, shared Redis module

## Notes
- Run `/gsd:execute-phase 1` to start Phase 1 execution
- 4 plans: 01-01 (scaffold+schema), 01-02 (auth+rbac+decimal), 01-03 (admin+quality), 01-04 (audit+health+swagger)
- Wave order: 01-01 → [01-02 ∥ 01-03] → 01-04
- 7-phase roadmap follows critical path: Foundation → Master Data → Contract → Obligation → Billing → Invoice → Admin UI
