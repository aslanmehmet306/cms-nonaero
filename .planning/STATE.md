## Session Log

- 2026-02-28: Project initialized via /gsd:new-project
- 2026-02-28: Deep questioning completed — vision, constraints, preferences captured
- 2026-02-28: 4 parallel research agents completed (Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls)
- 2026-02-28: REQUIREMENTS.md created — 83 v1 requirements, 11 v2 deferred
- 2026-02-28: ROADMAP.md created — 7 phases, full requirement coverage

## Progress

[==--------] Phase 1: 1/4 plans complete

## Key Decisions

- Docker Compose Full: API + PostgreSQL + Redis all containerized
- Multi-currency from v1 (TRY + EUR + USD) — differs from original docs
- Admin portal first, tenant portal deferred to v2
- e-Fatura deferred — Stripe invoice = sole document for v1
- Single airport demo (ADB), multi-airport architecture-ready
- Amendment: next full period only (no mid-month proration)
- MAG: no carry-forward, monthly independent
- YOLO mode, parallel execution, research + plan-check + verifier enabled
- pnpm@9.15.0 with corepack for reproducibility
- All 25 enums as string-value TypeScript enums for runtime safety
- Prisma schema uses @default(uuid()) for all IDs, @db.Decimal for all monetary fields
- Seed uses upsert for idempotent re-runnable seeding

## Blockers

(none)

## Session Log (continued)

- 2026-03-01: Phase 1 research completed (01-RESEARCH.md) — HIGH confidence
- 2026-03-01: Phase 1 planning completed — 4 plans in 3 waves
- 2026-03-01: Plan-checker found 4 blockers, 5 warnings — all fixed
- 2026-03-01: Plans revised: Task split, PostgreSQL 15 fix, auth paths per API docs, unit tests added, health prefix excluded, shared Redis module

## Performance Metrics

| Phase-Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |

## Last Session

- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T00:06:29+01:00
- **Stopped at:** Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

## Notes

- Phase 1 execution in progress: 01-01 complete, next up: 01-02 (auth+rbac+decimal) and 01-03 (admin+quality) can run in parallel
- 4 plans: 01-01 (scaffold+schema), 01-02 (auth+rbac+decimal), 01-03 (admin+quality), 01-04 (audit+health+swagger)
- Wave order: 01-01 (DONE) → [01-02 ∥ 01-03] → 01-04
- Docker/PostgreSQL not installed on dev machine -- migration and seed deferred
- 7-phase roadmap follows critical path: Foundation → Master Data → Contract → Obligation → Billing → Invoice → Admin UI
